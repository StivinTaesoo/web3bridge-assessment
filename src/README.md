# ABOUT THE PROJECT

This project is a shopping mall designed to give users a good online shopping experience built 

## Impletation tools
- The project is developed using reactjs
- React dynamic routing is used for the page navigations
- React Context is used in the implementation of global scope variable in the project

## Products
- The product items for this project were not fetched from an external API. The product were created locally in the project
- The products images are downloaded from jumia.com

## Challenges
-  Time was quite a limiting factor in the project as I wrestled against time and network speed. In the end I focused on achieving the shopping cart functionality, leaving behind the styling of the project.
  
## Conclussion
This test has braced me up for the challenge that lies ahead in my programming career and I'm better placed to handle more time-limiting challenges.
